# unity_starwipe
Just a little demo of using a shader and renderTexture to make a stupid starwipe gag.

press UP to starWipe in
press DOWN to starWipe out

starter shader i used (i added a color overlay to get that thick white border on the star)

ideas to make this fancier:
animate the texture sizes so that the star "expands" instead of scaling it up (this would allow you to "cut" to your star camera more seamlessly instead of staying on the renderTexture)
